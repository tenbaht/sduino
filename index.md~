# Sduino

_**Porting the most important features of the Arduino API to the STM8S.**_

Within a few minutes you are ready to compile and upload your first
STM8S-based project while still retaining the flexibility to use ST's SPL
functions.

All you need to get started is a simple STM8S103F breakout board for 70
cents and a ST-Link V2 compatible flash programmer for $2.50. Three boards
and one flash programmer together are available for well under five dollars
including shipping on
[aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=stm8s103f3p6).

*Amazing!*


### Usage

The recommanded way of installation is now the Arduino Board Manager:

- Open the Settings tab of the Preferences dialog
- Enter
  `https://github.com/tenbaht/sduino/raw/master/package_sduino_stm8_index.json`
  as an Additional Boards Manager URL
- Select *sduino* in the Boards Manager list (Tools->Board:...->Boards Manager)
- Click on Install

Wait for the download to finsh and you are ready to blink:

- Open the Boards list at Tools->Board:...
- You should find a new entry "STM8S Boards".
- Choose *STM8S103F3 Breakout Board* from the list
- Open the standard Blink example from File->Examples->01. Basics->Blink
- Compile it by hitting 'Verify'

Wasn't too hard, was it?



### Included libraries

Some Arduino libraries are already ported to C-syntax. The resulting API is
still very close to the C++ version and porting an existing application is
not hard. Check out the [API migration guidelines](api.md) for details.

#### Communication

* [SPI](api/SPI.md): Real hardware-SPI up to 10MHz.
* [I2C](api/I2C.md): Port of the I2C master library by Wayne Truchsess
* HardwareSerial: The standard serial interface.

#### Displays

* [LiquidCrystal](api/LiquidCrystal.md): HD44780 based text LCDs
* [PCD8544](api/PCD8544.md): Monochrome graphical LCD based on the PCD8544
  controller like the Nokia 5110 display. SPI mode only.
* [Mini_SSD1306](api/Mini_SSD1306.md): SSD1306-based monochrome OLED displays
  with 128x64 pixels. I2C support only.

#### Motor control

* [Stepper](api/Stepper.md): Stepper motors with 2, 4 or 5 phases.
* [Servo](api/Servo.md): Up to 12 servos using only 1 timer.



### Supported Systems

* Linux 64 bit: Tested on Ubuntu 16.04
* Linux 32 bit: Tested on Ubuntu 16.04
* Windows: Tested on Windows 7. Sduino might work on XP (not tested), but
  the ST-Link/V2 driver is not available anymore for XP.
* MacOS: Not tested, but should be very close to working. Will need a manual
  install, but IDE integration should be easy now. Any volunteers?
* Raspian/Raspberry Pi: Untested. Will require a manual install.
