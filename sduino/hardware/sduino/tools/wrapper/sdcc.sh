# wrapper around SDCC to let the external interface look more gcc-alike
#
# Differences:
# - if a .cpp files is given as input temporarly copy it to .c and compile it
#   as a c file. This will break the dependency check, as it expects the the
#   full original filename, but as this happens only for the original .ino
#   file it is not a big loss.
# - generate .rel files, but copy them as .o files as well to satisfy the
#   dependency checker on following builds

	# It has the positive side effect of converting from Windows to Unix
