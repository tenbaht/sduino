## Further reading and application notes

[A series of
articles](https://lujji.github.io/blog/bare-metal-programming-stm8/) on bare
metal programming of the STM8S CPUs. By far the best introduction I
found so far. It would have helped me a lot if it would have around at the
time when I started this project.

[Quick introduction to the Arduino.mk

Many [examples and presentations about the
STM8S](https://github.com/VincentYChen/STM8teach)

It contains the [SPL examples from
ST](https://github.com/VincentYChen/STM8teach/tree/master/code/Project/STM8S_StdPeriph_Examples),
one of the most useful resources on the STM8.

## Similar or related projects

None of these projects are related to or part of Sduino. They are written
independently, but with a similar goal in mind: To simplify STM8 programming
for the beginner.

[STM8Sduino](https://github.com/dannyf00/STM8Sduino): A minimalistic
approach to adopt parts of the Arduino-API to the STM8. Based on IAR and
COSMIC compiler (Windows only). Port to SDCC shouldn't be too hard but is
not done yet. Low overhead, but basic functions only. No support for porting
Arduino libraries.


## Other interesting STM8-related projects
