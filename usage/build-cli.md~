# Building with the Makefile

A preconfigured IDE is a great way to start, but sooner or later you will
want more control and flexibility.

The [manual install](manual-install.md) of Sduino comes with an easy-to-use powerful
Makefile based on the amazing [Arduino.mk
makefile](https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile) by
[Sudar](http://sudarmuthu.com>).

Let's blink an LED using the Blink example from Arduino:

```c
/*
  Blink
  Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  This example code is in the public domain.
*/

#include <Arduino.h>

// Pin 13 has an LED connected on most Arduino boards.
// Pin 3 for the STM8S103 break out board
// give it a name:
int led = LED_BUILTIN;

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // initialize the digital pin as an output.
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(led, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(led, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
}
```

All we need for a full build is this very basic `Makefile` (adopt the path
of the include statement for your situation):

```make
BOARD_TAG	= stm8sblue

include ../../sduino/sduino.mk
```

Compile and upload it:

	make upload

Done! Your first STM8 based project is up and running!
