# LiquidCrystal_pcf2119 Library

This library is for character LCDs based on the PCF2119 controller and
connected via I2C. The more common case is a LCD based on the HD44780
controller and a parallel interface connected to a small interface PCB with
an I2C parallel interface PCF8544. These two interfaces are **not
compatible** with each other. That kind of display will require the
[LiquidCrystal_LCD](LiquidCrystal_LCD) library instead.

PCF2119 based displays are pretty rare in the wild. They seem to have been
used in older fax machines and multi function printers, but thery are hard
to come by nowerdays (read: expensive. North of 20€ at Farnell).

This Library is derived from the Arduino LiquidCrystal library v1.8.0 with
some additions from the LiquidCrystal_LCD library.



## API

This library is a singleton library, it is not possible to use more than one
instance per sketch.

This Library is a SDuino original: There is no preexisting Arduino library
for this controller. The API syntax is designed to be very similar to the
regular [LiquidCrystal library](LiquidCrystal) for LCDs with a parallel
interface. The API syntax is very similar to the original C++ syntax, thanks
to some [c preprocessor macro magic](../developer/macro).

Apart from the usual name mangeling for polymorph functions (mostly the
different variants of the Print::print method) moving the opening bracket at
the class declarator line and replacing the dots in the method names for
underscores is all it needs.

## Example

Output some Text and count the time since the last reset. Notice the
slightly different position of the opening parenthesis at the "class
constructor" function LiquidCrystal compared to the C++ instatiation.

```c
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <LiquidCrystal_pcf2119.h>

// initialize the library with the number of the reset pin
// The instance name "lcd" is *within* the brackets
LiquidCrystal_pcf2119 (lcd,PA3);

void setup() {
  lcd_begin(16, 2);
  lcd_print_s("hello, world!");
}


void loop() {
  lcd_setCursor(0, 1);
  lcd_print_u(millis() / 1000);
}
```


Compare it to the (hypotetical) Arduino C++-Sytax:
```c
#include <LiquidCrystal_pcf2119.h>

// initialize the library with the number of the reset pin
// The instance name "lcd" is *before* the brackets
LiquidCrystal_pcf2119 lcd(2);

void setup() {
  lcd.begin(16, 2);
  lcd.print("hello, world!");
}

void loop() {
  lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
  lcd.print(millis() / 1000);
}
```


## Differences between this lib and LiquidCrystal_I2C

### Physical interface

The PCF2119 supports the standard command set as the HD44780, the only
visible difference is the physical interface. Supporting I2C natively means
very easy read and write access, very similar to the ease of use of a full 8
bit parallel interface.

This library can be seen as an extended version of the regular
LiquidCrystal_I2C using 8 bit mode instead of bit-banging a four bit
interface. Or as an I2C-enabled version of LiquidCrystal in 8-bit mode.




### Character mapping

This is a head-banging one. Such an engineering nonsense. The PCF2119 exists
in six different versions, supporting six different character sets named A,
D, F, I, R and S. See page 19ff in [the
datasheet](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/PCF2119X.pdf).

A is a standard ASCII mapping, R is the most random one where not even space
is at the position it is supposed to be. And guess which character set is
used by the modules still available at Farnell? Right, the R set. The ones
no one was willing to buy before.

This means that the build-in clear function can't be used and the
ShiftLeft/ShiftRight modes are not useful as they fill up the free space
with 0x20 - which happens to be an arrow in this character set. Who came up
with *that* idea?

The R set is the default case if no other character is specified at
initantiation time. So if you were lucky enough to lay your hands on a
display with a more useful character set you can tell the library about your
success:

```c
// Use character set A instead of the dreaded R
LiquidCrystal_pcf2119 (lcd,PA3,'A');
```



## Possible improvements

This is not a to-do-list, just brainstorming and a collection of random
thoughts.

### Unify all the LiquidCrystal libraries
It would be very slick to unify all three libraries/four interface modes
into one, similar to
