The Arduino project was very successful in offering a simplified API hiding most of the complexity of embedded system programming while still allowing for advanced programming technics. The SPL (standard peripheral library) offered by ST is very powerful and provides an relativly easy migration path towards the STM32 CPU series in case a project outgrows the capabilities of the 8-bit STM8 series. But using that library is not very intuitive and still requires a fairly detailed knowledge of the CPU internals. compiling the SPL with SDCC Tools used This project is based on free tools that are available for Linux, MacOS, and Windows. It uses the small devices C compiler (SDCC) for compiling, stm8flash for uploading the binary to the CPU, and simple Makefiles for the build process. Support for the Cosmic compiler under Windows and integration into the ST visual developer IDE might be possible, but is not done (yet?). The build process is controlled by a makefile based on the amazing Arduino.mk makefile by Sudar . Project origin For a customer I needed to port an existing project from an ATmega to a better suited (read: cheaper) platform. As the project was based on some Arduino libraries, porting parts of the Arduino environment was the logical first step. After doing that porting the firmware was finished in a couple of days. Porting some of the more commonly used Arduino libraries was a fun project done in my spare time later.

Direct port access As long as the pin numberings are known at compile time it would be possible use direct port register access and the access pattern could be optimized if all data pins are on the same port. Auto-detect 4-bit mode The parameter fourbitmode of the init() function/method is not needed. It would be sufficient to check d5 for a valid value. If it is not valid, assume 4-bit mode. As init() is not called very frequently the possible advantage would be small compared to the downside of breaking the Arduino compatibility.","title":"LiquidCrystal character LCD library"},{"location":"api/LiquidCrystal/#liquidcrystal-library","text":"This library is for character LCDs based on the HD44780 controller.

Supporting I2C natively means very easy read and write access, very similar to the ease of use of a fully connected 8 bit parallel interface without losing so many port pins. This library can be seen as an extended version of the regular LiquidCrystal_I2C using 8 bit mode instead of bit-banging a four bit interface. Or as an I2C-enabled version of LiquidCrystal in 8-bit mode. Character mapping This is a head-banging one. Such an engineering nonsense. The PCF2119 exists in six different versions, supporting six different character sets named A, D, F, I, R and S. See page 19ff in the datasheet . A is a standard ASCII mapping, R is the most random one where not even space is at the position it is supposed to be. And guess which character set is used by the modules still available at Farnell? Right, the R set. The left over ones no one was willing to buy so far. This means that the build-in clear function can't be used and the ShiftLeft/ShiftRight modes are not useful as they fill up the free space with 0x20 - which happens to be an arrow in this character set. Who came up with that idea? For character set A, D and I all data is always transferd unmodified. For character sets F, R and S the write() method transparently swaps the ASCII ranges 0x20..0x7f and 0xa0..0xff. This allows the use of the regular print functions without the need to think about the character encoding. The ranges 0x00..0x1f and 0x80..0x9f are transfered unmodified to enable the use of user defined characters. The additional function data() writes data directly into the display RAM, without any modifications and independed from the chosen character set. The R set is the default case if no other character is specified at instantiation time. So if you were lucky enough to lay your hands on a display with a more useful character set, this is the way to tell the library about your success: // Use character set A instead of the dreaded R LiquidCrystal_pcf2119 (lcd,PA3,'A'); Possible improvements This is not a to-do-list, just brainstorming and a collection of random thoughts.

This library is a stripped-down version of the original Adafruit_SSD1306 library v1.1.2. This version of the library does not depend on the Adafruit_GFX library and has a much smaller memory footprint than the full version, but most of the graphical features are missing. The Library only supports I2C communication. Limitations This Library uses a full display buffer. For a 128x64 display this requires 128x64 = 8kbit = 1kB of RAM for the display buffer. Since the STM8S103 has only 1kB RAM total, there is no way that this will fit.

Optimized for a minimal memory footprint. Only SPI mode supported. Uses soft-SPI, does not need the SPI pins. This is a modified version of the PCD8544 library written by Carlos Rodrigues . It is ported from C++ to C syntax and is meant to be used with the sduino environment for the STM8. This library is meant to have a minimal memory footprint. If you need graphics and other features and can spare the resources, check out the library from Adafruit (no sduino/STM8 port yet, though). API Thanks to some c preprocessor macro magic the API syntax is very similar to the original C++ syntax. Apart from the usual name mangeling for polymorph functions replacing the dots in the method names for underscores and a small modification of the initializer code should be enough.

Relationship between PWM/analog output and Servo output It is not possible to use a timer for PWM and the Servo Library at the same time. Since this library currently uses timer1, the PWM function ( analogWrite() ) is disabled for the pins connected to timer1 (for the STM8S103 this is pin PC3 and PC4 or digital pin 5 and 6). Pins connected to timer2 (PA3, PD3, PD4, digital pin 2,12,13) are still usable for PWM output. Possible improvements A more sophisticated pseudo-OO API Define a set of preprocessor macros that more OO-like definitions like this become possible: Current syntax OO-like syntax Arduino syntax myservo = Servo_attach(pin); myservo_attach(pin); myservo.attach(pin); Servo_write(myservo, val); myservo_write(val); myservo_write(val); val = Servo_read(myservo); val = myservo_read(); val = myservo_read(); Optimizing the handle_interrupts() function SDCC compiles this function very inefficiently. The code size is around 500 Bytes, and it is executed as part of the CC interrupt routine. Expected CPU load for a full servo group of 12 servos is approx. 2%. (Calculated for 16MHz CPU clock, 13 interrupts every 20ms = 650 interrupts/sec, approx. 500 clock cycles each) Using more than one CC channel per timer it might be possible to use all capture+compare (CC) channels of one timer at the same time, attaching one servo group to each CC-channel. This way it would be possible to serve up to 48 servos using the four CC-channels of timer TIM1.

The API syntax is very similar to the original C++ syntax, thanks to some c preprocessor macro magic . The declaration supports polymorphism, so all that is needed to adopt an existing sketch for use with sduino is moving the opening bracket at the class declarator line and replacing the dots in the method names for underscores.

In C this doesn't happen automatically. Most libraries implement a begin() method for exactly this purpose, but this one does not include an explicit constructor method. Instead, the output mode is set automatically right before the very first motor step. This means that the driver pins stay uninitialized and are left floating from the time of power up until the first step is requested. This won't be a problem in most cases as most motor drivers are using pull-up or pull-down resistors to ensure proper signal levels. If needed, the application could call the added activateOutputs() method in the setup() function to force an immediate port pin initialization: setup() { myStepper_activateOutputs(); // initializes the motor pins to output mode } Assigning the pin connections at run time The way the instantiation macro works requires compile-time constant values for all parameters (see below in section 'Implementation Details'). In order to be able to (re-) configure the pin connections at run time this version of the library implements the functions 2phase() , 4phase() and 5phase() . These functions act like a constructor and allow for full re-initialisation of an already existing \"object\". If you need to (re-) configure the pin connections at run time (e.g. read it from a configuration EEPROM first) you can initialize a data structure with 0 for the unknown pin numbers and set them later by calling the right xphase()-function: Stepper (myStepper,0,0); setup() { ... figure out the pin numbers somehow ... myStepper_4phase(stepsPerRev, pin1, pin2, pin3, pin4); ... } loop () { ... myStepper_setSpeed(60); myStepper_step(100); ... } 5 phase support can be deactivated to save code space 5 phase motors are not very common, but supporting them increases the code size significantly. By defining the compiler flag NO_5PHASE it is possible to deactivate the support for 5 phase motors. This saves 736 bytes of code space. Add this line to your Makefile if you don't need 5 phase support: CFLAGS = -DNO_5PHASE Example Notice the slightly different position of the opening parenthesis at the \"class constructor\" 'function' Stepper compared to the C++ instantiation.

Luckily, not many C++ features are used and in most cases a conversion is not very hard. In most cases a conversion from C++ to C it is just a matter of exchanging a dot for an underscore: A C++ method name class.method() becomes a C function name class_method() . This is possible since most libraries are written to be used as a singleton anyway, so the fixed name prefix is not a problem. Only very few libraries need a slightly more complex approach to be able to deal with multiple instances. There are two bigger problems left: Polymorph functions The concept of polymorphism does not exist for plain C. As a workaround 'mangled' function names are used for the different parameter type combinations supported by the original polymorph methods. Typical name extensions are: _u for unsigned values, _i for signed integer values, _c for characters, _s for strings, _n for data buffer/length combinations. For more non-regular polymorphism the name extension is often related to the different use cases or to the names of the given parameters. Refer to the respective library header file for details. Some examples of typical name changes: C++ name C name Serial.print(int) Serial_print_i Serial.print(unsigned) Serial_print_u Serial.print(float) Serial_print_f Serial.print(char) Serial_print_c Serial.print(char *) Serial_print_s Serial.print(char *buf, int len) Serial_print_n Serial.print(unsigned n, int base) Serial_print_ub random(long) random random(long howsmall, long howbig) random_minmax The _Generic selection The C11 standard introduced the _Generic selection function. This function allows for automatic selection of different function variants at compile time depending on the type of the function arguments mimicing polymorph C++ functions. Recent versions of SDCC already support this function (command line argument --std-sdcc99 ), but it's usefulness is still limited to some special cases. #define Serial_print(X) _Generic((X), \\ char*: Serial_print_s, \\ signed long: Serial_print_i, \\ signed int: Serial_print_i, \\ signed char: Serial_print_c, \\ unsigned long: Serial_print_u, \\ unsigned int: Serial_print_u, \\ unsigned char: Serial_print_u \\ )(X) This would unify some, but not all print function variants: C++ name C name using _Generic Serial.print(int) Serial_print Serial.print(unsigned) Serial_print Serial.print(char) Serial_print Serial.print(char *) Serial_print_s Serial.print(char *buf, int len) Serial_print_n Serial.print(unsigned n, int base) Serial_print_ub Unfortunately cpp does not match string constants and char* resulting in a very non-regular usage pattern: char *string=\"Hello\"; Serial_print(string); // works Serial_print(\"Hello\"); // doesn't work Serial_print_s(\"Hello\");// works To avoid too much confusion it might be better to not use _Generic at all. Another problem using the _Generic selector is configurable instance names. The preprocessor does not allow for variable macro names. That means _Generic would work with fixed name like Serial , but it wouldn't work for SoftwareSerial with no standard instance name. Inheritance from Print class Most character output modules inherit methods from the Print class by providing a virtual write method. A similar result can be achived by providing a function pointer to the write function to be used to the print functions. This additional parameter is hidden from the user by providing more convinient defines in every library that need to 'inherit' functions from Print. This way lcd.print(\"Hello World!\") becomes lcd_print_s(\"Hello World!\") and Serial.print(\"Hello World!\") becomes Serial_print_s(\"Hello World!\") . Both call the same code from Print, but with different function pointers to their own putchar/write function. Libraries with multiple instances If multiple instances need to be supported, an approach similar to a C file descriptor is used. The \"constructor\" function allocates and initializes a data structure for one particular instance and return a pointer to this structure. Typically, this is done in the setup() -function and this pointer is stored in a global variable to be used as a device descriptor. So far the Stepper library is the only example: #include <Stepper.h> Stepper myStepper; // variable to store the \"device descriptor\" void setup(void) { myStepper = Stepper_2phase(100,11,12); // init a 2 phase stepper } void loop() { Stepper_step(myStepper, 20); // do 20 steps forward } Differences from the original Arduino environment Additional output pin modes Pin mode Pin properties OUTPUT output, push-pull, slow mode (default) OUTPUT_OD output, open drain, fast mode OUTPUT_FAST output, push-pull, fast mode OUTPUT_OD_FAST output, open drain, fast mode Timer millis() uses timer4. The prescaler and end value is calculated at compile time for a cycle time as close to 1ms as possible. Default values @16Mhz: prescaler=64, counter cycle=250 (end value=249), resulting in exactly 1ms intervals. timer1: PWM for PC3, PC4, on alternate mapping PC6, PC7, could be used for ADC timer2: PWM for PA3, PD3, PD4 or PC5 (mutual exclusive) timer4: millis() Leaving out unused parts Some functions of the core Arduino system can be left out on compilation to save code space. This is done by compiler flags that can be defined in the Makefile: BOARD_TAG = stm8sblue CFLAGS = -DNO_SERIAL -DNO_ANALOG_IN -DNO_ANALOG_OUT include ../../../sduino.mk These flags are supported: Flag Bytes saved Functions lost NO_SERIAL 765 all serial communication NO_ANALOG_OUT 406 analogWrite() NO_ANALOG_IN 56 analogRead() Other modifications makeWord(unsigned char, unsigned char) is an inline function now. Additional compile-time flags Some internal details can be influenced by setting compile-time defines using the CFLAGS=-Dflagname line in the Makefile. SUPPORT_ALTERNATE_MAPPINGS : Allow the use of alternateFunctions() ENABLE_SWIM : Do not disable the remote debugging function on the SWIM pin. This means that this pin can not be used for normal I/O functions. USE_SPL : Use SPL functions for I/O access instead of direct register accesses. Useful only for debugging and porting to other CPU variants. Do not use for regular development. General notes on the Arduino port ADC the prescaler is initialised for an ADC clock in the range of 1..2 MHz. The minimum prescaler value is 2, so for a clock speed of less than 2 MHz the required minimum ADC clock frequency can not be reached anymore. Mapping of logical pin numbers to register addresses The lookup-table approach for assigning port and bit adresses to the logical pin numbers is not effient on the STM8. The hole system could be changed to a more regular scheme and replace the tables by hardcoded adress calculations. Inefficient compilation digitalWrite compiles very ineffiently. It might be worth some hand optimization. Accessing the alternate pin functions Added alternateFunction() to allow switching of some pins to their alternate functions. This allows for three more PWM pins, but maybe it adds to much complexity for the Arduino API. Not sure if it should stay. Has to be enabled by defining SUPPORT_ALTERNATE_MAPPINGS . Useful CPU features that are not supported by the Arduino API Input-Capture-Mode: Available for all four channels, at least for timer1. Would be great for precise time measurements.

The challenge is to keep the syntax differences to the real C++-based Arduino system as small a possible while still using plain C. There are subtle differences in the API concepts of the Arduino libraries. Unfortunatly, they all require different strategies to mimic a C++ user API. The basic criteria are: multi-instance or single-instance is a constructor call mandatory or not (typically the begin() -method) Additionally, there are some more detailed destinctions: polymorph instantiation declaration or simple declaration general single instance library or pre-instantiated single instance library inheritance via virtual methods (most output-type libraries inherit from the Print class) As a result, there are several different cases to consider: Single-instance, pre-instantiated, with constructor The data is kept locally within the class module. There is no instantiation declaration. No instance references need to be passed to any any function calls. All initialization is done by the constructor function. This is the easiest and most straight-forward case. No help from the preprocessor is required. It is sufficient to choose the function names to match the original class::method names. Polymorph methods are represented by a set of name-mangled functions. The behaviour of this construction is very similar to a real C++ class. Examples: SPI , I2C , HardwareSerial #include <I2C.h> setup() { I2c_begin(); I2c_write(0x1e, 0x02,0x00); } Required preprocessor help none Single-instance, with constructor The data is kept locally within the class module. The instantiation declaration defines the one instance name to be used. It might pass some configuration data which is remembered for later use. As there is always exactly one instance, no instance references need to be remembered and passed to any function calls. The instance name is more a cosmetic issue. The constructor does the actual configuration and initialization. It might use the configuration data given earlier with the instantiation declaration. The behaviour of this construction is very similar to a real C++ class. Polymorph instantiation declarations are possible. Non-constant values for the initialization are supported. Examples: LiquidCrystal int rs_pin = 2; LiquidCrystal (lcd, rs_pin,3,4, 5,6,7,8); setup() { lcd_begin(16,2); lcd_setCursor(0,1); lcd_print_s(\"Hello, world!\"); } Required preprocessor help polymorph instantiation remember configuration data for later use with the constructor setting up alias definitions to include the instance name in the function names. Multi-instance class, with constructor The data can be kept locally within the class module. The constructor allocates and initializes the required data structure and does required I/O-initializations. It returns a reference item to identify the instance. This reference item is typically a pointer to the instance structure or and index number to an internal table. It is passed to any following method call. The behaviour of this construction is very similar to a real C++ class. The main pitfall is the missing automatic destructor call. Luckily, this C++ feature is rarely used, anyway. Polymorph instantiation declarations are possible. Examples: Servo #include <Servo.h> Servo(servo1); Servo(servo2); setup() { servo1_attach(5); servo2_attach(6); } loop() { servo1_write(90); servo2_write(150); } Required preprocessor help polymorph instantiation remember configuration data for later use with the constructor save the instance reference item on initialization setting up alias definitions to include the instance name in the function names and include the instance reference item with the parameter list of every function call. Multi-instance class, no constructor As there is no strictly defined first function call which could allocate and initialize internal data structures, the data has to be kept in a data structure in the user area. A pointer to this data structure is passed to any following method call. This case can be difficult. As there is no dedicated constructor call, the library has to keep track if the current instance has been initialized already and has to do so if not. That means, that the needed I/O resources can't be initialized before the first function call. That might be a problem for some applications as I/O pins might stay in a floating input state for quite some time. Second drawback of this concept is the fact, that the instance data initialization values have to be known at compile time and can't be variables or the result of function calls at run time, e.g. from a configuration space in EEPROM. To solve these two problems it might be necessary to introduce an additional constructor-type function, that can be called from the setup() function or for any needed reconfiguration. Since the instance data is in the user space anyway, it could be modified there directly. But this would be an even worse violation of all modularization concepts and should be avoided. Polymorph instantiation declarations are possible. Examples: Stepper By requiring the user to add a call to the added constructor as the mandatory first call to the instance it could be treated as any other multi-instance class with constructor, see above. The resulting API is not identical to Arduino anymore, but still very similar. #include <Stepper.h> Stepper (StepperA, 100, 6, 7); Stepper (StepperB, 200, 8, 9, 10, 11); void setup() { StepperA_setSpeed(60); StepperB_setSpeed(60); } void loop() { StepperA_step(20); StepperB_step(40); } Required preprocessor help polymorph instantiation. convert the instantiation declaration into an instance data item declaration and initialization. setting up alias definitions to include the instance name in the function names and include a pointer to the instance data item with the parameter list of every function call. Inheritance Most output-type libraries inherit the methods from class Print by providing a matching write() method. This works by providing all print functions a function pointer to the write function, that should be used. Required preprocessor help setting up alias definitions to include the instance name of the output module in the function names of the print functions and include a pointer to the output write function with the parameter list of every (aliased) print function call.","title":"C preprocessor macro magic"},{"location":"developer/macro/#preprocessor-macros-to-disguise-plain-c-as-c","text":"Porting some Arduino-like functions to C is not too difficult.

Second drawback of this concept is the fact, that the instance data initialization values have to be known at compile time and can't be variables or the result of function calls at run time, e.g. from a configuration space in EEPROM. To solve these two problems it might be necessary to introduce an additional constructor-type function, that can be called from the setup() function or for any needed reconfiguration. Since the instance data is in the user space anyway, it could be modified there directly. But this would be an even worse violation of all modularization concepts and should be avoided. Polymorph instantiation declarations are possible. Examples: Stepper By requiring the user to add a call to the added constructor as the mandatory first call to the instance it could be treated as any other multi-instance class with constructor, see above. The resulting API is not identical to Arduino anymore, but still very similar. #include <Stepper.h> Stepper (StepperA, 100, 6, 7); Stepper (StepperB, 200, 8, 9, 10, 11); void setup() { StepperA_setSpeed(60); StepperB_setSpeed(60); } void loop() { StepperA_step(20); StepperB_step(40); }","title":"Multi-instance class, no constructor"},{"location":"developer/macro/#required-preprocessor-help_3","text":"polymorph instantiation. convert the instantiation declaration into an instance data item declaration and initialization. setting up alias definitions to include the instance name in the function names and include a pointer to the instance data item with the parameter list of every function call.","title":"Required preprocessor help"},{"location":"developer/macro/#inheritance","text":"Most output-type libraries inherit the methods from class Print by providing a matching write() method.

Using the same pin numbering scheme as with the stm8blue boards it looks like this: Differences between the '003 and the '103 CPUs Very slim. All differences that I could find so far: Feature STM8S003 STM8S103 EEPROM size 128 Bytes 640 Bytes I am not sure why the '003 is sold for half the price, or, to put it the other way around, why anybody should choose the '103 at all. Did I miss an important difference? Using the Wifi connection The ESP-14 is basically an ESP-01 Wifi-module together with a STM8S breakout board combined into one PCB. The ESP part comes preprogrammed with the usual ESP AT-Firmware and is connected to the RX/TX pins of the STM8S. It feels like having a classic ATmega8-Arduino with a build-in ESP-01 module. Using the WiFiEsp library we could have a programming experience very similar to using an Arduino with a Wifi-shield or an Arduino Yun. The main problem is the limited flash space of the '003. Even the very basic WebServer example that comes with the WiFiEsp library needs more then 14kB flash and more than 1kB RAM when compiled for an Arduino Uno. Even if the library could be carefully optimized to fit into the 8kB flash of an '003 - there would be no space left for the actual user code. It is still possible to do very simple task by just sending AT-strings to the ESP. But here we are definitly leaving Ardunio territory. Here we have to start from scratch and do it all by ourself. This is not going to be beginner-friendly anymore. The major remaining advantage of the STM8S over the ESP is power efficiency. The STM8S runs on almost nothing, while the ESP draws anything between 50 and 200mA even for the simplest tasks. In most cases you might want to implement the external communication part of the application on the ESP, using the ESP8266 Arduino port . The STM8S is better suited to local control and measurement and other energy- and time-critical tasks. Both CPUs use separate power supply inputs. Using an additional PMOS transistor the STM8S could control the power supply for the ESP and help extending battery life by activating the big brother only when its services are actually required. Poor design choice Overall, the '003 is a very questionable CPU choice by AI Thinker. The '003 is clearly one of the cheapest CPUs on the market, but the applications for this module are heavily restricted the the small flash memory. Why didn't they use an ATmega328? Just one dollar more and the whole Arduino universe opens up. Or at least an STM8S005K6T6C, offering 32kB flash and 2kB RAM for only 40 cents more, if you want to go really cheap. And why would you need an external PMOS to control the ESP power supply? Why is this not included on the PCB already? This could the big killer feature of the current combination. The upside Having a beefy 32 bit CPU and using it as an I/O-coprocessor while running the main application on an resticted 8-bitter is a weired concept. Things like the Arduino Yun or the Arduino WiFi-shield don't make too much sense. It is much more sensible to use the big CPU to control the small one than the other way around.

This is not a drop-in replacement for an AVR, but the programming API is still very, very similar. Adopting existing libraries from C++ to C for use with the simplified C API is often easy and can be done quite fast, depending on the degree of dependency on specific hardware features. Using a converter/compiler like cfront to translate from C++ to C might be an option. Float arithmetics Floating point arithmetics is supported by the SDCC standard library, but it comes at a pretty high cost in terms of code space and CPU load. This is how much the generated code grows by using a single float operation compared to using a long int: Floating point operation approx. code size addition 736 Bytes subtraction 754 Bytes division 673 Bytes multiplication 907 Bytes sinf() or cosf() 3346 Bytes log10f() 3437 Bytes The Arduino standard example '01.

It would be great if somebody would replace the painfully slow parameter checking part of the makefile (that causes the majority of forking) by a single shell script that gets called by the makefile and delivers the results in no time.

The fine line between sense and nonsense. When to use an STM8 - and when not Hobby applications The fairly new ESP-14 module includes a STM8S003F3P6: Wifi and a programmable I/O-CPU for just over two dollars - that might be the most compelling reason to get started on the STM8S series. Apart from pure curiosity and eagerness to learn something new, of course. The simple STM8S103F breakout boards are powerful and dirt cheap. They cost well under one dollar. You can get three boards and one flash programmer together for well under five dollars on aliexpress , including shipping from China. That is an extremely good opportunity to learn something new. The major downside of this CPU series is the lack of information and community support for the STM8. The community support and the sheer number of existing libraries for all kinds of sensors and hardware is outstanding in the Arduino world. Don't let the tempting price tag be your only guide. An Arduino Nano compatible board is not that much more expensive: They start at $1.90 on aliexpress . That is only $1.20 more than an STM8S. I am sure you can afford that. If you just want to get something done, go for an Arduino board. Nothing will give you faster and easier results. (Or an STM32F103 bluepill for the same price if you need more computing power). Tinkering and Repurposing The STM8 series by ST might be the cheapest CPUs on the market while still being as powerful as the ATmega series. That makes them every Chinese engineer's darling and chances are pretty good that you will find an '003 if you crack open any cheap appliance like an irrigation, temperature, or charging controller. Things like the W1209 thermostat boards could be useful for almost every kind of sensor application. There is plenty of cheap stuff around that only needs a different firmware to be used for something. And Sduino might be just the right tool to help you doing this. Commercial applications For commercial use the STM8S offers some interesting advantages: Motor control : The STM8 has a strong focus on motor and position control systems. Things you need to handle yourself on an ATmega are implemented in hardware and work independently of the state of the software. There is even hardware support for quadrature encoders as used in position sensors and rotary encoders. Low power modes : The numbers in the datasheets don't look that different, but in real life the STM8 can be powered two or three times longer using the same battery capacity due to the finer control on the power modes (very, very careful programming required). Value for the money : 40 to 60 cents for a STM8 with 14 I/O pins compared to $1.60-$3.00 for an ATmega8. Upgrade path : The peripheral units of the STM8 are identical or at least very, very similar to the ones used with the STM32 family of 32 bit ARM-Cortex CPUs. This makes it is relatively easy to migrate existing software between the 8- and the 32-bit world. This is quite unique among the other CPUs.","title":"When to use an STM8S - and when not"},{"location":"usage/why-stm8/#why","text":"The fine line between sense and nonsense.","title":"Why?"},{"location":"usage/why-stm8/#when-to-use-an-stm8-and-when-not","text":"","title":"When to use an STM8 - and when not"},{"location":"usage/why-stm8/#hobby-applications","text":"The fairly new ESP-14 module includes a STM8S003F3P6: Wifi and a programmable I/O-CPU for just over two dollars - that might be the most compelling reason to get started on the STM8S series.
