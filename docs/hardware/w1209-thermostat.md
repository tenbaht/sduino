# W1209 Thermostat module

Insanly cheap module with a relay, 3 digit display and a sensor connector.
All of that for $1.60 including shipping!

STM8S000F3P6 microcontroller, 8 KB Flash, 1 KB RAM, 128 bytes EEPROM

- 12V supply voltage
- One relay with indikator LED, max. 5A DC or 15A AC
- three buttons
- three digit 7-segment-display, multiplexed
- external NTC temperture sensor, 10k

But please be aware that the PCB layouts violates all common safety rules on
the high voltage side. No sufficient creeping distance, the PCB traces are
way too small to actually carry 15A and the screw terminals are not up to
that task either.
